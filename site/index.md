# althing — Run synthetic focus groups with any LLM

 v1.7.0 — public beta

# althing

Run synthetic focus groups with any LLM.

Zero-config inside Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, and other MCP hosts — the host's own model answers, so you can drop the config in and run one-shot prompts and quick polls of up to 3 personas with **no API key set**. Bring your own key (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok, local) for full panels, ensembles, and reproducible model pins. Personas and instruments are plain YAML — run from your terminal, a pipeline, or an AI agent's tool call over MCP (Model Context Protocol, the open standard that lets AI tools call external functions).

$ pip install althing

Add the `[mcp]` extra — `pip install "althing[mcp]"` — for Claude Code / Cursor / Windsurf agent integration.

## Who is this for?

Three jobs althing does well — pick the one closest to yours.

Startup PM

### No research budget, still need signal

Pressure-test a landing headline, pricing tier, or feature name in 5 minutes with `run_quick_poll` — no recruiting, no calendar tag, no screener. Paste the result into your spec doc and keep moving.

UX researcher

### Faster turnaround, sharper studies

Run a synthetic pre-filter before booking real participants — shortlist the probes that land, kill the questions that don't, and walk into every recruited session with a tighter discussion guide.

AI engineer

### Panels as a tool inside your agent

Embed althing in an agent pipeline via MCP tool calls, or drive it from Python to validate prompts, evals, and routing decisions against simulated audiences at every build.

Who this isn't for

althing is **CLI-first, local-first, BYOK-first** by design. It does **not** ship:

- a hosted web UI or dashboard

- a managed SaaS tier

- SSO, RBAC, or audit-log infrastructure

- SOC 2 (or equivalent) compliance attestation

These are **deliberate non-features**, not a roadmap gap. If you need a hosted GUI or enterprise compliance artifacts for a vendor review, althing isn't your product — and that's intentional.

## See it in action

A `run_quick_poll` against three personas, with the auto-synthesis at the bottom. This is the raw shape of what you get back.

# Question
"Would you pay $29/month for a tool that runs synthetic focus groups?"

── Sarah Chen · 34 · Startup PM ───────────────────────────
Honestly? Yes, for a quarter. $29 is under my no-approval-needed
threshold, and if it saves me one botched launch that's already paid
back. I'd want to see at least one real-world validation case first.
verdict: yes  confidence: 0.7

── Marcus Patel · 41 · Senior UX Researcher ───────────────
Not as a replacement for recruited studies, but as a pre-filter — yes.
$29 is cheap enough that I'd expense it personally. My concern is bias:
I need to know how the personas were selected before I trust the
synthesis.
verdict: conditional  confidence: 0.6

── Priya Okafor · 29 · AI Engineer ────────────────────────
I'd pay it to skip building the scaffolding myself, but I'd want an
API, not just a CLI. If it plugs into my agent via MCP I'm in at $29,
probably $99 if the SDK is clean.
verdict: yes  confidence: 0.8

── Synthesis ──────────────────────────────────────────────
3/3 lean toward yes at $29, but each attaches a condition:
  • PM wants a validation case study before committing
  • Researcher wants transparency on persona selection / bias
  • Engineer wants SDK + MCP parity, signals $99 ceiling
Consensus: price is not the blocker; trust + integration depth are.
themes: price-fit, bias-transparency, sdk-parity, mcp-integration
```

Example output, formatted for readability. Real results are returned as structured JSON via CLI or MCP tool call.

## MCP Server

Give your AI coding assistant access to synthetic focus groups. Drop this config into your editor and start running panels from chat.

```
// Claude Code · Cursor · Windsurf · Zed
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "althing": {
      "command": "althing",
      "args": ["mcp-serve"],
      "env": { "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "sk-..." }
    }
  }
}
```

Claude Code Cursor Windsurf Zed Claude Desktop [Full MCP docs →](/mcp)

Requires `pip install althing[mcp]`. 12 tools: run prompts, run panels, manage persona & instrument packs, and more.

## Quick start

```
# 1. install
pip install althing

# 2. add a key — env var (one-shot) or stored (persistent)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-..."             # env var
# or: althing login --provider anthropic --api-key sk-...   # persisted

# 3. one-shot prompt against the default model
althing prompt "What do you think of the name Traitprint?"

# 4. run a full panel and save the result
althing panel run \
  --personas examples/personas.yaml \
  --instrument examples/survey.yaml \
  --save

# 5. render a shareable Markdown report from the saved result
althing report <result-id> -o report.md
```

More commands: `althing pack calibrate` (calibrate a persona pack against a SynthBench baseline), `althing instruments` (manage branching instrument packs), `althing analyze` (statistics on saved results), `althing results` (list and inspect saved runs by ID), `althing cost` (spend summary), `althing login` / `whoami` (credential management). Run `althing --help` for the full list.

Every `althing report` output opens with a mandatory synthetic-panel banner — *“Synthetic panel. All responses below were generated by AI personas, not human respondents. Do not cite as user-research data.”* — so the rendered Markdown can’t be mistaken for real-user research. Markdown v1 only; HTML deferred to v2. See the [sp-viz-layer spec](https://github.com/DataViking-Tech/Althing/tree/main/specs/sp-viz-layer).

## Measured against real humans

The [SynthBench](https://synthbench.org) benchmark’s ground truth is real survey respondents — the General Social Survey (NORC), the Pew American Trends Panel (via the OpinionsQA, SubPOP, and GlobalOpinionQA datasets), and the World Values Survey — and every number below is recomputable from public data and open code. GSS is public-use, so for it the real human answer shares are shown directly.

Real General Social Survey question (2024 wave, item `GSS_LIFE`) — GSS is public-use data, so the real human answer shares appear side by side with the synthetic ones:

“In general, do you find life exciting, pretty routine, or dull?”

Exciting humans 36.8% · synthetic 26.7%

Pretty routine humans 56.7% · synthetic 73.3%

Dull humans 5.7% · synthetic 0.0%

Don’t know humans 0.7% · synthetic 0.0%

For every option, the top bar (green) is the real human share and the bottom bar (blue) is the synthetic share — the same values printed as text beside each option label. Humans: GSS 2024, NORC — public-use data, weighted shares (`wtssnrps`). Synthetic: gemini-2.5-flash via the SynthBench harness, run 2026-07-15, 30 sampled responses.

Measured divergence between the two distributions: Jensen–Shannon divergence 0.046 (0 = identical distributions, 1 = disjoint).

This item is one of that run’s closest matches; across all 75 GSS questions the same run’s mean JSD is 0.301. Because NORC releases GSS into the public domain, the full per-question payload — real distribution included — is served openly at [synthbench.org/data/question/gss/GSS_LIFE.json](https://synthbench.org/data/question/gss/GSS_LIFE.json) (no sign-in), alongside 59 more GSS items, and is recomputable from the [NORC GSS release](https://gss.norc.org) with the open [SynthBench harness](https://github.com/DataViking-Tech/SynthBench) (`leaderboard-results/gss_openrouter_google_gemini-2.5-flash_20260715_175807.json`).

Real Pew American Trends Panel question (Wave 96, via SubPOP item `BELIEVE_a_W96`):

“Do you believe in Heaven?”

Pew’s response data is license-gated (CC-BY-NC-SA), so this page shows only the *gap* between the Althing 3-model ensemble (90 sampled responses) and the real Pew respondents — not the survey values themselves:

Yes, I believe in this gap: 20.3 pts

No, I do not believe in this gap: 16.0 pts

Refused gap: 4.3 pts

Each bar is the measured option-level gap |synthetic − human| for that answer option, in percentage points (shorter bar = closer match). These are observed differences on this one question, not an error bound.

Measured divergence from the real Pew respondents’ distribution: Jensen–Shannon divergence 0.035 (0 = identical distributions, 1 = disjoint).

This item sits in the run’s closest decile by JSD; across the full 200-question SubPOP evaluation the same run’s mean JSD is 0.208. View the underlying distributions signed-in at synthbench.org, or recompute these exact numbers from the public [SubPOP dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jjssuh/subpop) and the open [SynthBench harness](https://github.com/DataViking-Tech/SynthBench); the synthetic distribution and per-question JSD are published in the repo (`leaderboard-results/subpop_ensemble_3blend_20260716_192413.json`, run dated 2026-07-16).

Powers the [SynthBench](https://synthbench.org) open benchmark — an open, reproducible evaluation of synthetic-respondent quality (public data + scoring code), operated by the Althing maintainers rather than an independent third party. On the current [leaderboard](https://synthbench.org/data/leaderboard.json) (generated 2026-07-17), the 3-model ensemble scores SPS 0.877 on opinionsqa, 0.858 on subpop, and 0.813 on globalopinionqa — roughly 0.03–0.05 above the best single model on each dataset and 0.10–0.11 above the random baseline (~0.71–0.76). Leaderboard numbers move as the board recomputes.
