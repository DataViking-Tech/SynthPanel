# Task-Oriented Recommendations — Picking a Persona Pack + Model Config

> **Audience:** AI agents (and the humans configuring them) deciding which
> persona pack and which model setup to use for a given research task.
> This page is the "what should I run?" lookup; the deep references are
> [docs/model-packs.md](model-packs.md) for the model configurations and
> [README §Builtin persona packs](../README.md#builtin-persona-packs-14-232-personas-total)
> for the full persona-pack catalogue.

## TL;DR — task → pack → model

| Task / decision shape | Persona pack | Model config | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Product positioning / messaging** | `product-research` (20) | `fast-cheap-preflight` for iteration → `balanced-research-ensemble` before any claim leaves the building | PMs and researchers will steelman your wording; ensembles narrow which lines actually generalize across model families |
| **Broad mass-appeal copy / naming** | `broad-professionals` (20) | `consumer-mass-appeal` weighted split, or `balanced-research-ensemble` before publishing | "Person on the street" coverage; if results will be cited externally, use the model-diverse ensemble |
| **Enterprise GTM / procurement narrative** | `enterprise-ai-buyers` (18) **and/or** `skeptical-executives` (18) | `skeptical-red-team-ensemble` (`sonnet,gpt-4o,gemini-2.5-pro`) at `--temperature 0.9` | These personas are vendor-fatigued and ROI-fixated; the higher-rigor ensemble surfaces objections cheaper models miss |
| **Trust / credibility / methodology audit** | `market-research-critics` (16) | `skeptical-red-team-ensemble` | Hostile audience by design — pair with the model pack that doesn't agreement-bias |
| **Pricing discovery** | `general-consumer` (15) or audience-specific pack | `fast-cheap-preflight` for tier shape → `balanced-research-ensemble` for the actual price point | Cheap models lock in the shape; spend on the ensemble when the number matters |
| **AI / eval tooling discovery** | `ai-eval-buyers` (20) | `--best-model-for "Technology & Digital Life"` (SynthBench-driven) for single-model runs; `balanced-research-ensemble` for high-stakes | This audience reads benchmark numbers — match the model choice to leaderboard evidence |
| **Dev-tool feedback / technical positioning** | `developer` (15) or `startup-founder` (15) | `technical-founder-research` (`sonnet:0.4,gpt-4o:0.4,gemini-2.5-pro:0.2`) | Technical buyers detect glibness; weight toward the higher-quality families |
| **Hiring / talent / job-search messaging** | `recruiters-talent` (15) for employer-side, `job-seekers` (15) for candidate-side | `fast-cheap-preflight` for shape → `balanced-research-ensemble` for finals | Two distinct audiences — don't pool them; run separate panels |
| **Healthcare messaging / patient comms** | `healthcare-patient` (15) | `balanced-research-ensemble` by default; **never single-model for clinical/compliance** copy | Stakes are high; ensemble + `althing report` + human SME review is the floor |
| **Education / student outreach** | `students` (15) | `fast-cheap-preflight` for early loops; `consumer-mass-appeal` weighted split for finals | Age-skewed audience; the weighted split keeps cost down |
| **Founder / early-stage hypothesis testing** | `startup-founder` (15) | `fast-cheap-preflight` is enough until you're charging money | Founders forgive directional answers; save the ensemble budget for paying-customer questions |
| **Pre-launch / board-deck / go-no-go** | Audience-appropriate pack (above) | `high-stakes-validation` 4-way ensemble + `--blend` | The one place you *should* spend on the full ensemble + blend |

> **Heuristic for the model-config column:** if a human is going to act
> on the answer, use an **ensemble**. If an agent is just orienting
> itself ("does this question even make sense?"), `fast-cheap-preflight`
> is fine. The SynthBench-driven `--best-model-for "<topic>"` slot is
> for the in-between case: a single model, chosen by leaderboard
> evidence rather than vibes.

## When single-model is acceptable

Use a single cheap model (`fast-cheap-preflight`) when:

- You're iterating on the **instrument** itself (wording, branching,
  schema), not the answer. The shape of the responses tells you whether
  the question is legible; the content barely matters yet.
- You're **dry-running** a panel before a real spend — verifying
  persona attachment, attachment refs, output format, etc.
- The decision downstream is **reversible and low-stakes** — internal
  team naming, a Slack-only experiment, draft copy you're going to
  rewrite anyway.
- The decision is **directional**, not quantitative — "are people
  excited or skeptical?" rather than "what % would buy at $79?".

Use a **SynthBench-recommended** single model (`--best-model-for
"<topic>"`) when:

- You need a single number/distribution and want it to be backed by
  leaderboard evidence. The CLI prints the choice + Synth-Population
  Score (SPS) + JSD to stderr before the run, so the choice is
  inspectable and overridable. See
  [docs/recommended-models.md](recommended-models.md) for the full flag
  reference.

## When to escalate to an ensemble

Switch to a model-diverse ensemble (`balanced-research-ensemble` or
heavier) when **any** of the following is true:

- The answer will be **acted on** by a human or autonomous agent —
  shipped copy, a price tier, a positioning line, an investor message.
- The answer will be **cited externally** — pitch deck, blog post,
  podcast, conference talk.
- The audience is **professionally skeptical** (`market-research-critics`,
  `enterprise-ai-buyers`, `skeptical-executives`). Single-model panels
  systematically underweight objections for these audiences because
  cheap models agreement-bias.
- The cost of a **false positive** ("ship this") is much higher than
  the cost of a slower decision.
- You need **dispersion** signal — `synthesis.disagreements` and
  `synthesis.surprises` are much richer when models with different
  training data disagree.

The cost ratio is real: a 4-way ensemble runs the full panel 4×, so
budget accordingly. See [docs/ensemble.md](ensemble.md) for the
mechanics and the `--blend` aggregation algorithm.

## Copy/paste commands

Each row below is a complete, runnable invocation against a bundled
persona pack. Export the pack first (the CLI takes a file path, not a
pack name); the MCP / SDK surfaces accept the pack name directly.

### Product positioning — fast iteration

```bash
althing pack export product-research > /tmp/product-research.yaml
althing panel run \
  --personas /tmp/product-research.yaml \
  --instrument /tmp/positioning.yaml \
  --model haiku \
  --output-format json
```

```jsonc
// MCP equivalent
{
  "tool": "run_panel",
  "arguments": {
    "pack_id": "product-research",
    "instrument": { /* ... */ },
    "model": "haiku",
    "decision_being_informed": "iterating positioning before final commit"
  }
}
```

### Product positioning — pre-publication ensemble

```bash
althing panel run \
  --personas /tmp/product-research.yaml \
  --instrument /tmp/positioning.yaml \
  --models 'haiku,sonnet,gemini-2.5-flash' \
  --blend \
  --output-format json
```

```jsonc
{
  "tool": "run_panel",
  "arguments": {
    "pack_id": "product-research",
    "instrument": { /* ... */ },
    "models": ["haiku", "sonnet", "gemini-2.5-flash"],
    "decision_being_informed": "finalizing the launch positioning"
  }
}
```

### Enterprise GTM — skeptical ensemble

```bash
althing pack export skeptical-executives > /tmp/skeptical-executives.yaml
althing panel run \
  --personas /tmp/skeptical-executives.yaml \
  --instrument /tmp/gtm-pitch.yaml \
  --models 'sonnet,gpt-4o,gemini-2.5-pro' \
  --blend --temperature 0.9 \
  --output-format json
```

```jsonc
{
  "tool": "run_panel",
  "arguments": {
    "pack_id": "skeptical-executives",
    "instrument": { /* ... */ },
    "models": ["sonnet", "gpt-4o", "gemini-2.5-pro"],
    "temperature": 0.9,
    "decision_being_informed": "stress-test the GTM pitch before a CRO review"
  }
}
```

### Trust / credibility audit — hostile audience

```bash
althing pack export market-research-critics > /tmp/market-research-critics.yaml
althing panel run \
  --personas /tmp/market-research-critics.yaml \
  --instrument /tmp/methodology-claim.yaml \
  --models 'sonnet,gpt-4o,gemini-2.5-pro' \
  --blend --temperature 0.9 \
  --output-format json
```

### AI / eval discovery — SynthBench-guided single model

```bash
althing pack export ai-eval-buyers > /tmp/ai-eval-buyers.yaml
althing panel run \
  --personas /tmp/ai-eval-buyers.yaml \
  --instrument /tmp/eval-tool-positioning.yaml \
  --best-model-for "Technology & Digital Life" \
  --output-format json
```

`--best-model-for` consults the SynthBench leaderboard for the named
topic and prints its choice to stderr before the run (see
[docs/recommended-models.md](recommended-models.md)). Override with
`--model <alias>` if you want to ignore the recommendation.

### Healthcare patient messaging — ensemble + report

```bash
althing pack export healthcare-patient > /tmp/healthcare-patient.yaml
althing panel run \
  --personas /tmp/healthcare-patient.yaml \
  --instrument /tmp/patient-comms.yaml \
  --models 'sonnet,gpt-4o,gemini-2.5-pro' \
  --blend \
  --save --output-format json \
| jq -r '.result_id' \
| xargs althing report --output patient-comms-panel.md
```

> **Never run healthcare comms on a single cheap model.** Use the
> ensemble + render to Markdown for human SME review before any patient-
> facing copy ships.

### Hiring messaging — two-sided

The employer-side and candidate-side audiences should run as **separate**
panels; pooling them dilutes the signal.

```bash
# Employer side
althing pack export recruiters-talent > /tmp/recruiters-talent.yaml
althing panel run --personas /tmp/recruiters-talent.yaml \
  --instrument /tmp/hiring-pitch.yaml --model haiku --save --output-format json

# Candidate side
althing pack export job-seekers > /tmp/job-seekers.yaml
althing panel run --personas /tmp/job-seekers.yaml \
  --instrument /tmp/hiring-pitch.yaml --model haiku --save --output-format json
```

## How the recommendations were chosen

These are not arbitrary defaults. They follow from three observations
that SynthBench surfaces in the live leaderboard data:

1. **No single model is best at everything.** Different families top
   different topic slices on
   [SynthBench](https://synthbench.org) — `claude-haiku-4-5` leads
   "Economy & Work", `gemini-2.5-flash` leads "Technology & Digital
   Life". Single-model panels inherit the leading model's blind spots
   wholesale. → ensemble for high-stakes work.
2. **Model-diverse ensembles narrow the variance to the human baseline**
   on most topics. The trade-off is cost (N× panel) and latency
   (parallel but bounded by the slowest provider). → reserve ensembles
   for decisions that will be acted on.
3. **Skeptical audiences are not just persona-skeptical — they're
   model-skeptical.** Cheap models agreement-bias against critical
   personas, so combining a hostile pack with a cheap model gives you
   *less* signal, not more. → pair `market-research-critics` /
   `skeptical-executives` / `enterprise-ai-buyers` with the
   higher-rigor ensemble.

For deeper context: [docs/model-packs.md](model-packs.md) walks each
model pack with cost order-of-magnitude;
[docs/recommended-models.md](recommended-models.md) covers
`--best-model-for`; [docs/ensemble.md](ensemble.md) covers the
`--models` syntax and `--blend` algorithm;
[docs/calibration.md](calibration.md) covers the human-baseline
calibration step that closes the loop.

## Status — docs-only for v1.5.1

The convenience flags the upstream issue floats —

```bash
althing pack list --recommend
althing models recommend --task positioning
althing recommend --task enterprise-gtm
```

— **do not exist yet.** This page is the agent-facing surface for
v1.5.1. The flags above would compile to the same recommendations
documented here; if/when they ship, this table becomes their
implementation reference.
