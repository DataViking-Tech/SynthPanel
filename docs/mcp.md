# MCP Server Reference

synthpanel ships an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server so AI agents can run synthetic focus groups as tool calls. The server uses stdio transport and defaults to the `haiku` model for cheap, fast iterative use.

## Starting the Server

```bash
synthpanel mcp-serve
```

The server communicates over stdin/stdout using JSON-RPC (the MCP protocol). It is designed to be launched by an MCP-aware editor or agent framework.

## Editor Configuration

### Claude Code / Claude Desktop / Cursor / Windsurf / Zed

The fastest path is the bundled installer (sy-skf, synthbench#262):

```bash
synthpanel mcp install                                 # writes ~/.claude.json (Claude Code)
synthpanel mcp install --scope project                 # writes ./.mcp.json (checked in)
synthpanel mcp install --host claude-desktop           # platform-specific Claude Desktop config
synthpanel mcp install --host cursor                   # ~/.cursor/mcp.json (--scope project → ./.cursor/mcp.json)
synthpanel mcp install --host windsurf                 # ~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json
synthpanel mcp install --host zed                      # ~/.config/zed/settings.json (context_servers schema)
synthpanel mcp install --host auto                     # detect installed hosts, confirm each (--yes accepts all)
synthpanel mcp install --target /path/to/mcp.json      # any other host with an mcpServers map
synthpanel mcp install --env ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...  # bake credentials into the entry (optional)
synthpanel mcp uninstall --host zed                    # remove exactly the entry the installer manages
```

The command merges into the host's existing servers map (`mcpServers`,
or `context_servers` for Zed — the written JSON matches the README's
per-host snippets exactly), never touches other servers or unrelated
settings, refuses to overwrite a clashing entry without `--force`, and
writes user-scoped files with mode `0600`. `--host auto` only offers
hosts whose user-level config file already exists — it never creates a
config for an editor that isn't installed. After a real write it prints
`Restart <host> to pick up the server.`

No secret is written unless you pass `--env` explicitly: by default the
entry has no `env` block and the installer prints a note pointing at
`synthpanel login` / provider env vars (sampling-capable hosts need no
key at all — see [Sampling Mode](#sampling-mode)).

The installer also refuses by default when the `mcp` optional extra
isn't installed in the current Python env — without it,
`synthpanel mcp-serve` would crash at launch time and the host would
report a generic "server failed to start" with no actionable hint. The
refusal points at the one-line fix (`pip install 'synthpanel[mcp]'`) and
mentions the `--allow-missing-extra` escape hatch for cross-machine
setups where the editor and the server live in different envs (sy-xyn).
Equivalent guard runs at `mcp-serve` start so a stale host config that
points at a bare-extras install still produces a usable error message
instead of a Python traceback.

`--dry-run` previews the change without touching disk. In text mode it
puts the human prose on stderr and the resulting JSON config on stdout,
so you can pipe the preview through `jq`, redirect it to a file, or feed
it back into the installer:

```bash
synthpanel mcp install --target ~/.cursor/mcp.json --dry-run
# stderr: Would install MCP server 'synth_panel' in /Users/you/.cursor/mcp.json.
# stdout: { "mcpServers": { "synth_panel": { ... } } }

synthpanel mcp install --target ~/.cursor/mcp.json --dry-run 2>/dev/null \
  | jq '.mcpServers.synth_panel'
```

In `--output-format json` mode the entire payload (action, entry, and
the full `resulting_config`) lands on stdout as a single JSON object
with no stderr noise — one stream, fully parseable.

If you'd rather hand-edit, the entry it produces is:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "synth_panel": {
      "command": "synthpanel",
      "args": ["mcp-serve"],
      "env": { "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "sk-..." }
    }
  }
}
```

Set the environment variable for whichever LLM provider you want to use. See the main [README](../README.md#llm-provider-support) for the full provider table.

Prefer a zero-config first run? Skip the `env` block entirely — see
[Sampling Mode](#sampling-mode) below.

### Claude Code Plugin

```
/plugin install synthpanel
```

This adds the `/focus-group` skill plus the `/synthpanel-poll` slash command to your Claude Code session. The plugin auto-discovers the bundled `commands/` and `skills/` directories.

Prefer to install without the plugin, or use a different host? See
[Agent Skills & Slash Commands](agent-skills.md) for manual copy
steps and guidance for hosts that don't speak Claude Code's
slash-command convention.

### Hermes

Hermes uses a YAML config with an `mcp_servers` map and explicit timeout
fields. Add this block to your Hermes config:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  synthpanel:
    command: "synthpanel"
    args: ["mcp-serve"]
    timeout: 180
    connect_timeout: 60
    env:
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: "sk-..."
```

If you don't want to install the `synthpanel` binary globally, use
[`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to fetch and run it on demand:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  synthpanel:
    command: "uvx"
    args: ["--from", "synthpanel[mcp]", "synthpanel", "mcp-serve"]
    timeout: 180
    connect_timeout: 60
    env:
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: "sk-..."
```

- `timeout` (180s) covers a full panel run — panels with many personas
  and rounds can take 60–120s in BYOK mode.
- `connect_timeout` (60s) gives the subprocess room to import the MCP
  Python SDK and providers on first launch.
- Drop the `env` block entirely if your Hermes host already advertises
  `sampling` and you want zero-config first-run (see
  [Sampling Mode](#sampling-mode)).

Restart Hermes after editing the config so the new server entry is
picked up.

### Other MCP hosts

Any host that speaks the MCP stdio transport works the same way: launch
`synthpanel mcp-serve` as a subprocess and pass provider keys through
the environment. The Hermes block above is the canonical shape — most
hosts map onto either that YAML form or the JSON form used by Claude
Code / Cursor / Windsurf. If your host needs an explicit transport
field, set it to `stdio`.

### Manual Install (Claude Code without plugin)

If you configured the MCP server manually (without `/plugin install`) you can still get all commands and skills by running:

```bash
synthpanel install-skills
```

This copies the bundled slash commands and skills into `~/.claude/`:

| Type | Name | Installs to |
|------|------|-------------|
| Slash command | `/synthpanel-poll` | `~/.claude/commands/synthpanel-poll.md` |
| Skill | `concept-test` | `~/.claude/skills/concept-test/SKILL.md` |
| Skill | `focus-group` | `~/.claude/skills/focus-group/SKILL.md` |
| Skill | `name-test` | `~/.claude/skills/name-test/SKILL.md` |
| Skill | `pricing-probe` | `~/.claude/skills/pricing-probe/SKILL.md` |
| Skill | `survey-prescreen` | `~/.claude/skills/survey-prescreen/SKILL.md` |

For a project-scoped install (places files in `.claude/` relative to the current directory instead of `~/.claude/`):

```bash
synthpanel install-skills --target .claude
```

The command is idempotent — running it again overwrites existing files with the current bundled versions.

## Frozen v1.0.0 Contract

Every panel-running tool call (`run_panel`, `run_quick_poll`, `extend_panel`)
**requires** a `decision_being_informed` string field. `run_prompt` does not.

- 12–280 chars, single line, UTF-8.
- Echoed verbatim into `panel_verdict.meta.decision_being_informed`.
- *Omitted* → v1.0.x grace: the server synthesizes
  `"unspecified-legacy-call"`, returns a `W_DECISION_MISSING` nudge in
  `warnings[]`, and proceeds; under `SYNTHPANEL_SCHEMA_MIN>=1.1.0` omission
  is a hard typed `MISSING_DECISION` reject.
- Provided but empty after trim → `MISSING_DECISION`. `<12` chars →
  `INVALID_TOOL_ARG`. `>280` → `DECISION_TOO_LONG`. No silent truncation.

Successful persisted panel runs return the `panel_verdict.json` artifact
(closed-shape, `schema_version: "1.0.0"`, closed `flags[]` enum) under the
envelope's `panel_verdict` key, alongside `synthesis`. Full reference:
[docs/response-contract.md](response-contract.md). Migration guide:
[docs/migration-v1.md](migration-v1.md).

Running panels unattended (CI, agent pipelines)? The operational contract —
typed errors and `retry_safe` semantics, partial-failure behavior, timeout
budgets, cost gates, checkpoint/resume, determinism, credential handling,
and log/stream discipline — is documented in
[docs/production-operations.md](production-operations.md).

## Tools (12)

> **Structured polling is the agent default.** Both `run_panel` and
> `run_quick_poll` accept a `response_schema` argument (JSON Schema
> dict) that forces structured output at generation time — no prose
> parsing required. See [docs/structured-polling.md](structured-polling.md)
> for the full pattern catalogue covering forced-choice, Likert,
> tagged-themes (objections/risks), confidence, and ranking, plus a
> runnable 35-persona prioritization example.

> **Picking which `pack_id` / `model` / `models[]` to pass?** See
> [docs/task-recommendations.md](task-recommendations.md) for the
> task → persona pack → model config lookup with copy/paste examples
> (positioning, GTM, pricing, trust audit, healthcare comms, hiring).

### Research Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `run_prompt` | Send a single prompt to an LLM. No personas required. The simplest tool — ask a quick research question. **Does not require `decision_being_informed`.** |
| `run_panel` | Run a full synthetic focus group panel. Each persona answers all questions independently in parallel, followed by synthesis. Accepts inline `questions`, an inline `instrument` dict (v1/v2/v3), or an `instrument_pack` name. Template placeholders in the instrument (e.g. the bundled packs' `{problem}` / `{candidates}`) are filled via the `vars` argument — the MCP equivalent of the CLI's `--var`. Optional `max_cost` (USD) arms the mid-run cost gate (see [`max_cost`](#max_cost-hard-spend-ceiling)). **Requires `decision_being_informed`.** |
| `run_quick_poll` | Quick single-question poll across personas. A simplified `run_panel` for one question with synthesis. Accepts inline `personas` and/or a saved `pack_id` (merged; falls back to a built-in diverse set when both are omitted). Optional `max_cost` (USD) spend ceiling. **Requires `decision_being_informed`.** |
| `extend_panel` | Append a single ad-hoc round to a saved panel result. Reuses each panelist's saved session for conversational context. **Not** a re-entry into the v3 DAG — use for human-in-the-loop follow-ups. Optional `max_cost` (USD) spend ceiling for the extension round. **Requires `decision_being_informed`.** |

### Tool-call examples

```jsonc
// run_panel
{
  "tool": "run_panel",
  "arguments": {
    "pack_id": "general-consumer",
    "instrument_pack": "pricing-discovery",
    "vars": { "problem": "tracking cloud spend across teams" },
    "decision_being_informed": "choosing launch tier price"
  }
}

// run_quick_poll
{
  "tool": "run_quick_poll",
  "arguments": {
    "question": "Which name feels most premium: Core, Plus, or Pro?",
    "pack_id": "general-consumer",
    "decision_being_informed": "naming the paid tier"
  }
}

// extend_panel
{
  "tool": "extend_panel",
  "arguments": {
    "result_id": "result-20260503-abc123",
    "questions": ["What would you pay for this if it shipped tomorrow?"],
    "decision_being_informed": "validating the indie pricing ceiling"
  }
}

// run_prompt — no decision_being_informed
{
  "tool": "run_prompt",
  "arguments": {
    "prompt": "Summarize the Q3 retention drop in two sentences."
  }
}
```

### Persona Pack Management

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_persona_packs` | List all saved persona packs (bundled + user-saved). Returns ID, name, persona count. |
| `get_persona_pack` | Get a specific persona pack by ID. Returns the full persona definitions. |
| `save_persona_pack` | Save a persona pack for reuse. Validates persona data before saving. |

### Instrument Pack Management

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_instrument_packs` | List installed instrument packs (bundled + user-saved). Returns manifest metadata. |
| `get_instrument_pack` | Load an installed instrument pack by name. Returns the full YAML body. |
| `save_instrument_pack` | Install an instrument pack. Validates the instrument via the parser before writing to disk. |

### Result Management

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_panel_results` | List all saved panel results. Returns ID, date, model, and counts. |
| `get_panel_result` | Get a specific panel result by ID. Returns the full result with all rounds and synthesis (`detail="full"` by default) — the canonical way to fetch the per-panelist transcript the run tools omit under their default `detail="summary"`. Pass `detail="summary"` for a metadata/synthesis-only peek. |

## Resources (4 URI Patterns)

MCP resources allow agents to read data without invoking a tool.

| URI Pattern | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `persona-pack://{pack_id}` | A specific persona pack |
| `persona-pack://` | List all persona packs |
| `panel-result://{result_id}` | A specific panel result |
| `panel-result://` | List all panel results |

## Prompt Templates (3)

Prompt templates provide pre-built research workflows that agents can use as starting points.

| Prompt | Parameters | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| `focus_group` | `topic` (required), `num_personas` (default: 5), `follow_up` (default: true) | Generate a structured focus group discussion prompt for a given topic. |
| `name_test` | `names` (required, comma-separated), `context` (optional) | Test product or feature name options with diverse perspectives. |
| `concept_test` | `concept` (required), `target_audience` (optional) | Test a concept or idea with targeted personas. |

## Response Shape

All panel runs (`run_panel`, `run_quick_poll`, `extend_panel`) return a uniform
response shape. The example below is `detail="full"`:

```json
{
  "result_id": "result-20260410-...",
  "model": "haiku",
  "persona_count": 5,
  "question_count": 3,
  "detail": "full",
  "rounds": [
    {
      "name": "discovery",
      "results": [
        {
          "persona": "Sarah Chen",
          "responses": ["..."],
          "usage": { "input_tokens": 450, "output_tokens": 120 },
          "cost": "$0.0012",
          "error": null
        }
      ],
      "synthesis": { "themes": [...], "summary": "..." }
    }
  ],
  "path": [
    { "round": "discovery", "branch": "themes contains price", "next": "probe_pricing" }
  ],
  "terminal_round": "probe_pricing",
  "warnings": [],
  "synthesis": { "themes": [...], "summary": "...", "recommendation": "..." },
  "poll_summary": { "questions": [...] },
  "per_model_results": { "haiku": { "usage": {...}, "cost": "$0.02", "result_count": 5, "personas": ["Sarah Chen", "..."] } },
  "cost_breakdown": { "by_model": { "haiku": "$0.02" }, "total": "$0.0234" },
  "total_cost": "$0.0234",
  "total_usage": { "input_tokens": 2250, "output_tokens": 600 },
  "results": [...]
}
```

- `rounds` — per-round results with panelist responses and per-round synthesis
- `path` — the routing decisions that fired (v3 branching instruments)
- `terminal_round` — the round whose synthesis fed final synthesis (present on
  every path, including flat `questions` runs where it is `"default"`)
- `warnings` — parser or runtime warnings
- `results` — back-compat flat array mirroring the terminal round's panelist results
- `per_model_results` — per-model `{usage, cost, result_count, personas}`. It does
  **not** duplicate the transcript: the panelist responses live only in
  `rounds[].results` (each row is `model`-tagged, so per-model slices are
  recoverable by filtering). The `models=[...]` ensemble path is the one
  exception — there each model ran independently, so it keeps a `results` block.

For v1/v2 instruments and raw `questions` input, `path` is empty or linear and
`warnings` is typically empty — the shape is uniform across versions.

### `detail`: compact-by-default responses

`run_panel` and `run_quick_poll` accept a **`detail`** argument — `"summary"`
(the default) or `"full"`.

- **`summary`** (default) returns `synthesis`, `panel_verdict`, `poll_summary`,
  `metadata`, `result_id`, costs, `per_model_results` (usage/cost only),
  `warnings`, `path` and `terminal_round`, but **drops the per-panelist
  transcripts** — the top-level `results` mirror and every `rounds[].results`
  list. With caps of `MAX_PERSONAS` (100) × `MAX_QUESTIONS` (50), a full panel's
  transcript can serialise to megabytes; keeping it out of the default response
  protects the agent's context window. The envelope marks the omission
  (`"detail": "summary"`, `"results_omitted": true`, per-round `result_count`)
  and points at the full copy via `transcript_uri` (also
  `panel_verdict.full_transcript_uri`).
- **`full`** returns every panelist row — the pre-existing shape.

The dropped transcript is always retrievable from the persisted result:

```jsonc
{ "tool": "get_panel_result", "arguments": { "result_id": "result-20260410-..." } }
```

or via the `panel-result://{result_id}` resource. `get_panel_result` defaults to
`detail="full"` (back-compat — every existing caller keeps getting the whole
result); pass `detail="summary"` for a cheap metadata/synthesis peek at a large
saved panel.

**Sampling** responses are never persisted (no `result_id`), so their transcript
is not retrievable later — sampling always returns full transcripts regardless of
`detail`. `extend_panel` returns its single appended round in full.

### `max_cost`: hard spend ceiling

`run_panel`, `run_quick_poll`, and `extend_panel` accept an optional
**`max_cost`** argument — a hard ceiling on the run's total spend, in USD. It
is the MCP analog of the CLI's `--max-cost` and wires into the same `CostGate`
machinery (`src/synth_panel/cost.py`): after each panelist completes,
`running_cost / completed_n * total_n` is compared against the ceiling.

```jsonc
// run_panel with a $2 ceiling
{
  "tool": "run_panel",
  "arguments": {
    "pack_id": "general-consumer",
    "questions": [{ "text": "What would you pay for this?" }],
    "max_cost": 2.0,
    "decision_being_informed": "choosing launch tier price"
  }
}
```

When the projection exceeds the ceiling the run **soft-halts**: the current
panelist(s) finish, no new panelists start, and synthesis is skipped (spending
more to summarize a deliberately-truncated panel would produce an
untrustworthy result). The response is still a **valid partial envelope** —
the completed prefix is persisted under `result_id` as usual — carrying:

```jsonc
// response (truncated) after a cost-gate trip
{
  "run_invalid": true,
  "cost_exceeded": true,
  "abort_reason": "cost_exceeded",
  "halted_at_panelist": 4,
  "cost_gate": {
    "max_cost_usd": 2.0,
    "running_cost_usd": 1.62,          // spend so far
    "projected_total_usd": 4.05,       // what tripped the gate
    "completed": 4,
    "total_panelists": 10,
    "halted": true,
    "halted_projection_usd": 4.05
  },
  "resume": {
    "partial_result_id": "result-20260716-...",
    "completed_panelists": ["..."],
    "remaining_personas": ["..."],
    "how_to_resume": "..."             // fetch partial via get_panel_result;
                                       // re-run remaining_personas with a raised cap
  },
  "synthesis": null                    // skipped on the partial
}
```

The partial envelope composes with `detail: "summary"` and still carries the
`panel_verdict` contract fields; the full partial transcript stays retrievable
via `get_panel_result(result_id)`.

Support matrix (mirrors the CLI's `--max-cost`, which the multi-round engine
refuses): `max_cost` applies to **BYOK** runs with inline `questions` (and
`extend_panel`'s single extension round). Combining it with sampling mode (the
host agent pays; the server sees no per-panelist costs), `models` ensembles,
`variants`, or `instrument` / `instrument_pack` inputs returns a typed
`INVALID_TOOL_ARG` on `max_cost` — a loud refusal before any spend, never a
silently unenforced ceiling. `max_cost` must be > 0.

### Typed error envelopes

Boundary errors return a typed `INVALID_TOOL_ARG` envelope
(`{ "error_code", "message", "field_path", "schema_version", "retry_safe",
"error" }`) rather than a raw FastMCP "Error executing tool":

- Unknown `pack_id` (`run_panel`, `run_quick_poll`), `instrument_pack`
  (`run_panel`), or `result_id` (`extend_panel`) → `INVALID_TOOL_ARG` naming the
  offending field and enumerating the available ids.
- `detail` outside `{"summary", "full"}` → `INVALID_TOOL_ARG` on `detail`.
- Unsubstituted `{placeholder}` tokens left in a resolved instrument after
  `vars` is applied (`run_panel`) → `INVALID_TOOL_ARG` on `vars`, naming the
  missing keys and showing an example `vars` payload. This fires even when
  `vars` is omitted entirely, so a placeholder-bearing pack can never send
  literal `{problem}` text to panelists. Passing `vars` alongside plain
  `questions` (no instrument) is likewise an `INVALID_TOOL_ARG` on `vars`.

Runtime failures on `run_panel`, `run_quick_poll`, and `extend_panel` are also
typed:

- Every panelist failing (e.g. a bad model alias that 400s upstream) →
  `{ "run_invalid": true, "total_failure": {...} }`.
- A per-panelist timeout budget exceeded → `{ "error_code": "PANEL_TIMEOUT",
  "retry_safe": true, "timeout_seconds": N }`.

## Model Resolution Order

Two questions are answered at the start of every MCP tool call: **which
execution mode** (sampling vs BYOK) and, in BYOK, **which default
model**. Both are deterministic and observable from the response payload
(`mode` and `model` fields).

Source of truth: `decide_mode()` in `src/synth_panel/mcp/sampling.py`
and `_resolve_mcp_default_model()` in `src/synth_panel/mcp/server.py`.

### Stage 1 — execution mode

| Host advertises `sampling`? | Provider key available? | `use_sampling` arg | Mode |
|------|------|------|------|
| yes | no  | (auto)  | **sampling** |
| yes | yes | (auto)  | **BYOK** — local key wins |
| yes | (any) | `true`  | **sampling** — even when a key is set |
| yes | (any) | `false` | **BYOK** — never sample |
| no  | no  | (auto)  | **error** — set a key OR use a sampling-capable client |
| no  | yes | (auto)  | **BYOK** |
| no  | (any) | `true`  | **error** — host did not advertise `sampling` |
| no  | (any) | `false` | **BYOK** — falls through to a missing-creds error if no key is set |

"Provider key available" means any of `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `XAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, or
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — checked first against the process environment,
then against the on-disk credential store written by `synthpanel login`
(so MCP-launched subprocesses recognise keys the CLI can see).

The auto rule "local key wins over sampling" exists so users who *have*
configured BYOK keep BYOK's full feature set (cross-provider ensembles,
structured-output extraction, deterministic model versioning, per-call
cost telemetry). Pass `use_sampling=true` to force the host's model
even with a key configured.

### Stage 2 — default model (BYOK only)

When `model` is omitted, the server picks a cheap-and-fast default
based on which credential is present. The preference chain is walked in
order; the first match wins:

| Order | Credential | Default alias |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| 1 | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `haiku` |
| 2 | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `gpt-4o-mini` |
| 3 | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | `gemini-2.5-flash` |
| 4 | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | `gemini-2.5-flash` |
| 5 | `XAI_API_KEY` | `grok-3` |
| 6 | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | `openrouter/auto` |
| (none) | — | `haiku` (terminal fallback; the LLM client surfaces the missing-creds error) |

**Large-panel fast default (sy-2ag / GH#462 / synthbench#261):** when
the panel has **≥ 10 personas** and `model` was *not* explicitly
supplied, a known-slow auto-resolved default is swapped for a fast
equivalent — today that means `openrouter/auto` →
`openrouter/anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5` (OpenRouter's auto-router can
pick a slow reasoning model, turning a 20-persona panel into a
15-minute stall). The same policy applies on all three surfaces (MCP,
SDK, `panel run`) via the shared `synth_panel.llm.fast_default` module,
and each surface emits a one-line note when the swap fires. An explicit
`model="openrouter/auto"` is always honored — the swap only touches the
implicit default.

Pass `model=` explicitly to override (e.g. `"opus"`, `"gpt-4o"`,
`"gemini-2.5-pro"`). The CLI's weighted-spec syntax
(`haiku:0.25,gpt-4o-mini:0.25`) is **not** supported on the MCP surface
— pass plain aliases. In sampling mode the `model` argument is ignored;
the host agent picks its own model, and the actual model used is
reported back in the response's `model` field.

### Tool coverage

`run_prompt` and `run_quick_poll` go through both stages and accept
`use_sampling`. `run_panel`, `extend_panel`, and the pack/result
management tools always use BYOK and skip Stage 1 — heavier workflows
benefit from direct provider access and structured outputs.

## Sampling Mode

MCP has a spec-level feature called
[**sampling**](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/client/sampling)
where the server can ask the invoking client to run an LLM completion
on its behalf. synthpanel uses this to deliver a zero-configuration
first-run UX: if you haven't set a provider API key and your client
advertises `sampling`, the `run_prompt` and `run_quick_poll` tools
borrow the client's own LLM access instead of failing.

See [Model Resolution Order](#model-resolution-order) for the full
configuration → mode matrix.

### Tradeoffs

Sampling mode is intentionally less capable than BYOK:

- **One provider.** The host agent picks the model (Claude Desktop →
  Claude; other clients may route through whichever provider they have
  configured). Cross-provider ensembles require BYOK.
- **No cost accounting.** Token usage is charged to the host agent's
  subscription; synthpanel returns `"usage": null` and `"cost": null`.
- **Capped panel size.** `run_quick_poll` is limited to 3 personas in
  sampling mode to protect the host agent's context window. Larger
  runs require BYOK.
- **No structured output extraction.** Free-text only.

These limits keep sampling mode focused on what it's for: a frictionless
first invocation that produces real results, not a replacement for the
research-grade BYOK path.

### Response fields

Sampling responses include two extra fields:

- `"mode"` — `"sampling"` or `"byok"` so downstream tooling can
  condition on the execution mode.
- `"hint"` — a one-line hint on the first sampling run explaining how
  to upgrade to BYOK. Safe to surface to end users.

### Opting in explicitly

Pass `use_sampling=True` (or `use_sampling=False`) to either tool to
override the automatic decision — useful when you have keys configured
but want a quick sampling-mode preview, or when you want to force BYOK
inside a sampling-capable client for reproducibility.

### Tools that support sampling

- `run_prompt` — no persona/question caps, fully supported.
- `run_quick_poll` — up to `SAMPLING_MAX_PERSONAS` (3) personas.

The remaining tools (`run_panel`, `extend_panel`, pack/result
management) always use BYOK — heavier workflows benefit from direct
provider access and structured outputs.

## Host Integration Flags

### `SYNTHPANEL_DRIFT_DEGRADE`

Controls what the server returns when the structured-output engine's 3-strike
retry budget exhausts (see the `sp-d1x0` retry policy).

| Setting | v1.0.0 default | v1.1.0 default | Behavior on exhaustion |
|---|---|---|---|
| unset / `0` | ✓ | — | Typed `SCHEMA_DRIFT` error envelope, `retry_safe: true` |
| `1` | — | ✓ | Degraded `panel_verdict.json` with `flags: [{ "code": "schema_drift", "severity": "warn" }]` |

**Semantics.** The `1` setting is the v1.1 default rolled out as an opt-in
beta in v1.0. The panel ran; the partial signal is returned with a flag the
agent can branch on. The off-by-default setting in v1.0 returns a typed error
instead, leaving the recovery decision to the caller.

**Rollback.** This is a runtime env flag — change it and restart the
server. No persisted state. To roll back from `1` to off, unset the env var
on the next launch.

**v1.1.0 migration.** The default flips to on. If your agent code relies on
seeing `SCHEMA_DRIFT` errors today, switch to checking
`flags[].code == "schema_drift"` before the v1.1 cutover. The CHANGELOG entry
for v1.1.0 will mark the flip.

Set in your MCP `env` block alongside provider keys:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "synth_panel": {
      "command": "synthpanel",
      "args": ["mcp-serve"],
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "sk-...",
        "SYNTHPANEL_DRIFT_DEGRADE": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

See [docs/response-contract.md](response-contract.md) for the full envelope
shape and [docs/migration-v1.md](migration-v1.md) for the grace-window state
diagram.

## Data Storage

Panel results, persona packs, and instrument packs are stored under `~/.synthpanel/` (configurable via `SYNTH_PANEL_DATA_DIR`):

```
~/.synthpanel/
├── persona_packs/          # Saved persona packs (YAML)
├── packs/instruments/      # Installed instrument packs (YAML)
└── results/                # Panel results (JSON) + session data
```

## Troubleshooting

### `command not found: synthpanel`

The MCP host can't see the `synthpanel` binary on its `PATH`. This is
the single most common failure mode, because MCP subprocesses inherit
the host's PATH — not your shell's.

**Fixes, in order of preference:**

1. Install globally so any host can find it:
   ```bash
   pip install "synthpanel[mcp]"      # or pipx install "synthpanel[mcp]"
   which synthpanel                    # confirm the binary is on PATH
   ```
2. Or point `command` at the absolute binary path:
   ```jsonc
   "command": "/Users/you/.venv/bin/synthpanel"
   ```
3. Or run it through `uvx` so the host fetches it on demand:
   ```jsonc
   "command": "uvx",
   "args": ["--from", "synthpanel[mcp]", "synthpanel", "mcp-serve"]
   ```

Claude Desktop on macOS is particularly strict about PATH — it runs
under launchd and does not inherit your shell environment. Use an
absolute path or `uvx` for that host.

### Server starts but no tools appear

The server launched but the host isn't seeing `run_panel`,
`run_quick_poll`, etc. in the tool picker.

- **MCP extra missing.** `pip install synthpanel` alone is not enough —
  the MCP server requires the SDK from the `[mcp]` extra:
  ```bash
  pip install "synthpanel[mcp]"
  ```
- **Stale host cache.** Some hosts cache the tool list per server entry.
  Restart the host (full quit, not just window close) after editing
  config or upgrading the package.
- **Server logs.** Run `synthpanel mcp-serve` in a terminal to confirm
  it boots and produces no errors before the host launches it.

### Missing or invalid API key

Symptom: tool calls return `MISSING_CREDS` or a provider-specific
401/403 error.

- The MCP subprocess only sees env vars from the host's `env` block (or
  the host's inherited environment). Setting `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in
  your shell profile does **not** automatically propagate — put it in
  the `env` block of the MCP server entry.
- Run `synthpanel login` to seed the on-disk credential store; the MCP
  server reads from there as a fallback when the env is empty (see
  [Model Resolution Order](#model-resolution-order)).
- If your host advertises MCP `sampling` (Claude Desktop, Claude Code,
  Cursor, Windsurf), you can omit the key entirely and synthpanel will
  borrow the host's LLM access — see [Sampling Mode](#sampling-mode).

### Timeouts on long panel runs

Symptom: the host kills the subprocess mid-panel with a timeout error.

- A 5-persona × 3-question BYOK panel typically takes 30–90 seconds.
  Cross-provider ensembles and larger personas can take 2–5 minutes.
- Raise the host's per-tool timeout. For Hermes:
  ```yaml
  mcp_servers:
    synthpanel:
      timeout: 300         # 5 min for heavy panels
      connect_timeout: 60
  ```
  Other hosts use their own field names; consult the host's MCP docs.
- For exploratory work, prefer `run_quick_poll` (single question) over
  `run_panel` (full instrument) — it returns in seconds.

### Tool calls fail with `MISSING_DECISION`

Every panel-class tool (`run_panel`, `run_quick_poll`, `extend_panel`)
**requires** a `decision_being_informed` string (12–280 chars). This
is a frozen v1.0.0 contract requirement. See
[Frozen v1.0.0 Contract](#frozen-v100-contract) for the rule and
[docs/response-contract.md](response-contract.md) for the error
envelope. `run_prompt` does not require it.

### `SCHEMA_DRIFT` errors on synthesis

The structured-output engine's 3-strike retry budget was exhausted.
Either re-run the tool (transient model output drift is recoverable),
or set `SYNTHPANEL_DRIFT_DEGRADE=1` in the MCP `env` block to get a
degraded result with a `schema_drift` flag instead of an error — see
[Host Integration Flags](#host-integration-flags).
