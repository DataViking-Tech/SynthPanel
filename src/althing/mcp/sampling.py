"""MCP sampling bridge.

MCP's *sampling* feature lets an MCP server ask the invoking client
(Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, ...) to run an LLM
completion on the server's behalf, using the client's own subscription
or credentials. This lets althing give first-time users a
zero-configuration experience — no ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` setup needed
to fire their first prompt or quick poll.

Design
======

Two routing decisions live here:

1. **Can we sample?** — the client must advertise the ``sampling``
   capability (on the ``initialize`` handshake for legacy protocol
   revisions, or in the per-request ``_meta`` envelope on 2026-07-28+)
   and a :class:`Context` must actually be threaded through from the
   tool call. Exposed via :func:`client_supports_sampling`.

2. **Should we sample?** — we honour an explicit ``use_sampling`` flag
   on the calling tool; otherwise we fall back to sampling only when no
   BYOK credentials are present in the environment. Exposed via
   :func:`decide_mode`.

Transport (spec 2026-07-28 / SDK 2.0)
=====================================

*How* a sampling request reaches the client depends on the negotiated
protocol revision:

* **Handshake era (≤ 2025-11-25):** the server sends a standalone
  ``sampling/createMessage`` server→client JSON-RPC request mid-call via
  ``ctx.session.create_message``. This is the classic sampling flow.
* **Modern era (2026-07-28+):** the protocol defines *no* server→client
  requests at all. Instead the tool call returns an
  ``InputRequiredResult`` carrying the batched ``CreateMessageRequest``s
  plus opaque ``request_state``; the client fulfils them through its
  sampling callback and retries the call (SEP-2322 multi-round-trip).

:class:`SamplingBridge` abstracts over both: tool executors declare the
samples they need via :meth:`SamplingBridge.gather` and either receive
the results (mid-call on legacy; restored from ``input_responses`` /
``request_state`` on a modern retry round) or a :class:`SamplingSuspend`
propagates so the tool can surface the ``InputRequiredResult``.

Tool handlers call :func:`sample_text` / :meth:`SamplingBridge.gather`
once the decision is made.
